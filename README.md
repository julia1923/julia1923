My name is Julia Freitas, and I'm based in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Anhembi Morumbi. I'm passionate about crafting interfaces that combine visual design, functionality, and a truly intuitive user experience. I enjoy turning ideas into meaningful solutions that make sense to people. I'm constantly seeking to learn and grow as a developer, with the goal of building a strong path in web development.
